# Automation Testing Fundamentals with JavaScript

Welcome to my **JavaScript Automation Testing** repository!  
This project documents my learning journey and hands-on practice with fundamental programming concepts that are essential for automation testing using JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

The following core concepts are covered through example scripts:

- **Variables** – Declaration, initialization, and usage.
- **Data Types** – String, Number, Boolean, Array, Object, etc.
- **Conditional Statements** – `if`, `else`, `else if`, and `switch`.
- **Arrays** – Creation, iteration, and manipulation.
- **Functions** – Regular functions, arrow functions, parameters, and return values.
- **Objects** – Object creation, property access, and methods.
- **Classes** – Class syntax, constructors, methods, and inheritance.

These concepts build a strong foundation for working with automation testing tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright.
